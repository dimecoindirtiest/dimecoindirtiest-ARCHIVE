dimecoindirtiest
The non-scam alternative to dimecoin that became a scam.

DIRTY is cloned from Hirocoin

There are about 15 billion DIRTY officially. However, the developer of sooncoin and his friends decided to make sidechains on it. Total coin count is impossible to tell. It could be 500 billion for all I know.

But I leave it as reminder. Do not mine it or buy it. You are wasting your time.
